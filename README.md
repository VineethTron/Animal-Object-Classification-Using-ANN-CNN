# Animal-Object-Classification-Using-ANN-CNN
The basic idea of the project is to compare different neural network models on cifar10 dataset  and test the accuracy of model to predict an image and its class  Firstly we build a artificial neural network(ANN) which consists of three layers namely flatten and 2 dense layers. We then compile it and train it using the training set and upon testing we get the accuracy of 45 percentage Next we built a convolution neural network(CNN) using pair of convolution layers and pooling layers followed by dense and flatten layers for the output. This model on testing gives out the accuracy to be nearly 70 percentage and can be increased by increasing the epochs. Next we compare and display the outputs using classification report In a nutshell,  the classification can be done using both ANN and CNN where as CNN gives us better accuracy
